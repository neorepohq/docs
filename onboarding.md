# Onboarding

In this step, we'll set up onboarding.

## Components

Neorepo has a number of onboarding components assembled for after you sign up. You can use these components to build your own onboarding flow.

## Design

Neorepo uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style the onboarding components. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.

You can use Tailwind CSS to leverage the power of utility classes to style your onboarding components.
