# Contributing

We welcome contributions to Neorepo. Here are some ways you can help:

- Report bugs
- Suggest new features
- Write or edit documentation
- Write tutorials
- Write code (no pull requests are too small! Make a change to the docs, to the code, or to the tests)

## Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can help us by submitting an issue to our [GitHub Repository][https://github.com/neorepohq/neorepo]. Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

## Suggesting New Features

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Neorepo, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that Neorepo has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our GitHub Repository which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.
