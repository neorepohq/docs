# Environment Variables

In this step, we'll set up your environment.

## Vercel Environment Variables

Neorepo uses [Vercel environment variables](https://vercel.com/docs/environment-variables) to store secrets. Use the Vercel project you created in the previous step to set up your environment variables.

1. Open the Vercel project you created in the previous step
2. Click the "Environment Variables" tab
3. Add the following environment variables:

| Name | Value |
| ---- | ----- |

| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | |
| `DATABASE_URL` | |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | |
| `EMAIL_SMTP_HOST` | |
| `EMAIL_SMTP_PORT` | |
