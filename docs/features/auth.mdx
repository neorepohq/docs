# Authentication

In this step, we'll set up authentication.

## NextAuth.js

Neorepo uses [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org) to handle authentication. NextAuth.js is an open source authentication library for Next.js. It supports a number of authentication providers, including email, GitHub, Google, and more.

## Set up the database

NextAuth.js requires a database to store user information. Neorepo uses [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com) to store user information. Planetscale is a fully managed database service that's built on top of MySQL. It's designed to be a drop-in replacement for MySQL, so you can use the same tools you're already familiar with.

### Add your environment variables

1. Open the Vercel project you created in the previous step
2. Click the "Environment Variables" tab
3. Add the following environment variables:

|`NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | |
|`NEXTAUTH_URL`| |

NextAuth.js uses the `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` environment variable to sign cookies. It uses the `NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variable to set the `next-auth.url` cookie.

### Generate a secret

To generate a NEXTAUTH_SECRET, you can run

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

in your terminal or use this [website](https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32) to generate a value.

### NextAuth.js URL

NextAuth.js uses the `NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variable to set the `next-auth.url` cookie. This cookie is used to redirect users back to your app after they've signed in.

We've already set up `NEXTAUTH_URL` for you (see `package.json`), but you can also set it manually. To do so, set `NEXTAUTH_URL` to the URL of your Vercel project.
