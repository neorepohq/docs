# Database

In this step, we'll set up your database.

## Planetscale

Neorepo uses [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com) to store data. Planetscale is a fully managed database service that's built on top of MySQL. It's designed to be a drop-in replacement for MySQL, so you can use the same tools you're already familiar with.

### Create a database

1. Open the [Planetscale dashboard](https://app.planetscale.com)
2. Click the "Create Database" button
3. Enter a name for your database
4. Click the "Create Database" button

### Get your database URL

1. Open the [Planetscale dashboard](https://app.planetscale.com)
2. Click the database you created in the previous step
3. Click the "Connect" tab
4. Copy the database URL

### Set up your environment variables

1. Open the Vercel project you created in the previous step
2. Click the "Environment Variables" tab
3. Add the following environment variables:

| `DATABASE_URL` | `mysql://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>` |

### Create the database schema with Prisma

1. Open your terminal
2. Run the following command:

```bash
yarn prisma db push
```

This command will create the Prisma database schema for you and push it to your database.
